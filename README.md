Charlie Peck

I am a freshman in the business school at Lehigh.  I am not quite sure what I am going to major in, but I am currently leaning towards Finance.  On top of being a student here, I am also on the Varsity Lacrosse team.  I have really enjoyed my time here so far, and I'm excited for the next four years.
